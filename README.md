This is an project task written in C programming language to build a socket connection to a server by using TCP connection. After the TCP socket connection is done, user can do some file manipulation process example like user can send file to the server and server will save the file inside it. Besides the send file process, the user can download the file from the server to the local machine. User can also create file and delete the file that no longer needed. The parent process can be fork to many new child processes so that the connection can be concurrent to enable the server can be accessed by multiple client connetion requests at any particular time. After user done all the process, the user can disconnect from the server and the connection will be ended.
